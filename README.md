## Simple drum track player for musical practice.
### This prototype is a learning project in which I worked with 
### -TypeScript; 
### -Angular; 
### -WebAudio;
### -IndexedDB;
### -Tensorflow.js;

The player features a few selected drum tracks presented in a searchable table component. 
It also features a [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) pose model to allow gesture controls.
